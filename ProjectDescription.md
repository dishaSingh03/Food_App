Food App Project
Overview:
Welcome to the Food App, a dynamic web application built with React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project encapsulates modern front-end development practices, employing advanced concepts such as functional components, React Hooks, Router, Context API, and reducers to deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Features:
1. Add a Dish:
The Food App simplifies the process of adding new dishes to the menu. Leveraging the power of React's functional components and state management with hooks, users can effortlessly input details, and the app dynamically updates the menu in real-time.

2. Cart Functionality:
Enhancing the user experience, our app incorporates a robust Food ordering cart system. With React's Context API, managing the state of the cart across components becomes seamless. Users can easily review and modify their orders before finalizing the order.

3. Order Placement:
Streamlining the ordering process, the Food App utilizes React Router for smooth navigation between pages. Customers can seamlessly move through the order placement flow, providing a delightful experience with minimal page reloads.

Technologies Used:

React.js:

Utilizing the power of functional components for modular and efficient code.
Harnessing the capabilities of React Hooks for state management and side effects.
Leveraging the Context API for global state management, ensuring data consistency across components.

React Router:

Creating a single-page application (SPA) experience with smooth page transitions.
Enabling users to navigate through the app intuitively with a dynamic and responsive user interface.

HTML & CSS:

Crafting a visually appealing and responsive design for a seamless user experience.
Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
